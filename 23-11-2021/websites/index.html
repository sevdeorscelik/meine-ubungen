                    Often referred to as "The Typographer's Bible," Chapter 6 of
                    <strong> <i> The Elements of Typographic </i> </strong> Stylecovers
                    Choosing and Combining Type. Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose faces
                    that will survive, and if possible prosper, in the final screen
                    conditions" and to "choose faces that suit the task as well as the
                    subject." He tells us to "start with a single typographic family," but
                    when the time comes to combine fonts, "balance the type optically more
                    than mathematically."

                    One of my favorite sites,<i> <strong> Nice Web Type </strong> </i> strikes a balance between
                    typographic artistry and technical know-how. In the "fonts" section of
                    the site Brown writes, "You may have noticed, there are lots of
                    typefaces out there to choose among. Here you'll find the ones I
                    prefer, and my reasons."

                    While not a typographer himself, Bringhurst is a poet, with a love

                    through choosing and combining typefaces; striving for rhythm,
                    proportion, and harmony; and designing typographic pages.

                    From the website: <strong><i>I love Typography (ILT)</i></strong>
                    was born on August 7, 2007. It exists because I have a passion for
                    typography, type design, and lettering, and for the words born of
                    those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us to
                    draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had
                    an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make the subject more
                    accessible, to bring the study of typography to the masses, if you
                    will. It's just about impossible to imagine a world without type, but
                    at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us taking it for granted.

                    Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
                    often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
                    lithographer. In
                    <strong><i>Love and Joy About Letters</i></strong> he writes: "I
                    discovered the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere
                    dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters are
                    quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and the hand
                    can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet
                    sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are
                    the balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a matter
                    of skill and feeling and art."
