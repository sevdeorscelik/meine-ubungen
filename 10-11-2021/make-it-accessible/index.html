        <h2>What is Accessibility?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Accessibility</strong> (often abbreviated to A11y—as in "a"
          then 11 characters then "y") in Web development means enabling as many
          people as possible to use Web sites, even when those people's
          abilities are limited in some way.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many people, technology makes things easier. For people with
          disabilities, technology makes things possible. Accessibility means
          developing content to be as accessible as possible no matter an
          individual's physical and cognitive abilities and no matter how they
          access the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever
          their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or
          mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to
          people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive
          ability."
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>Assistive Technologies For Web Browsing</h2>
        <p>
          Individuals living with a disability use assistive technologies such
          as the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Screen reading software</li>
          <li>Braille terminals</li>
          <li>Screen magnification software</li>
          <li>Speech recognition software</li>
          <li>Keyboard overlays</li>
          <li>Subtitled videos</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Essential Components of Web Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          The accessibility of websites relies on the cooperation of several
          components:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>content – the information in a web page or web application</li>
          <li>web browsers, media players, and other "user agents"</li>
          <li>
            assistive technology, in some cases – screen readers, alternative
            keyboards, switches, scanning software, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            users' knowledge, experiences, and in some cases, adaptive
            strategies using the web
          </li>
          <li>
            developers – designers, coders, authors, etc., including developers
            with disabilities and users who contribute content
          </li>
          <li>authoring tools – software that creates websites</li>
          <li>
            evaluation tools – web accessibility evaluation tools, HTML
            validators, CSS validators, etc.
          </li>
        </ol>
