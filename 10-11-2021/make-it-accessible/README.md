# Make it Accessible!

## Part One

- Take a few minutes to look over the [live version of our site](https://digitalcareerinstitute.github.io/UIB-box-model-make-it-accessible/)
- What are at least five things we need to change to make the site more accessible and user friendly?
- Open **Chrome Dev Tools** and generate a report with [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) - for this example you only need to choose the options shown in the image below -

## Part Two

- Open the code in your editor
- Refactor the site using **semantic HTML**
- Generate another report using **Lighthouse** and make the suggested corrections until you reach a score of **100** for accessibility

### Tips

- Take a careful look at the `index.html` - some important things are missing
- You can style the page to your taste, just make sure the colour contrast, text sizes etc. are accessible and user friendly
